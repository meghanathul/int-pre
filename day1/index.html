    WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT
    -javascript is single threaded synchronous language which means it executed line by line .
    -i.e code run line by line.
    -javascript programing erlier use for UI design only.
    -But now with the help of node.js we can use use javascript for backend also.
    -single threaded means :
    if we run any code in browser and any error comes then the code wil stope there.
    it will not go further for execution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT ENGINE
    -js engin it used to help your code to execute.
    -in other language c,c++ we have complier.
    -when code is come to browser code get converted into machine code to understand browser.
    - then the code get taken by js engine and get executed.
    -JE use to give memory to variable.
    -JE create execution context.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    WHAT IS TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE
    - Temporal dead zone is a block where variable are ineccesible untile and unless
    it will get some value.
    - whenever we write any code it will get converted to machile code.
    - then it will gose to global execution context(GEC).
    -where it will allocated memory.
    -after it will go to code execution .
    -now the problem is if we want to excess the variable declare with let and const befor
    initializing .
    -then we will get error because it get store in script scope so we cant axcess it before
    initializing.
    - so for the solution of thise problem js introduce on cancept
    -that initialization of variable schould move top of the scope .
    ex-
    let a=0;
    console.log(a)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VAR LET AND CONST
    var:
    -var is a global scope variable.
    -when we declare any variable using var then it will get memory in global scope.
    -when we access any variable before initializing and it is declare with var then we get
    value as undefined.
    -var variable can be updated and redeclared also.
    syn-
    var a=10;

    let:
    -let is a block scope variable.
    -when we declare any variable using let then it will get memory in block scope(script scope).
    -when we access any variable before initializing and it is declare with let then we get
    reference error.
    -let variable can be updated but not redeclared .
    syn-
    let a=10;

    const:
    -const is a block scope variable.
    -when we declare any variable usingconstt then it will get memory in block scope(script scope).
    -const variable after declaration need to initialize also.
    -when we access any variable before initializing and it is declare with const then we get
    reference error.
    -const variable can't be updated and redeclared .
    syn-
    const a=10;

    WHAT IS TYPE OF OPERATOR
    -typeof operator basically use for check the datatype of any operant.
    - the operant can be any thing variable , function or object whose type u
    wont to find.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNDEFINED AND NULL
    -undefiend means the variable is gate declared but not initilize any value
    -it meanse the value dose not exist till.
    -undefine get assign by the memory. it is a datatype
    -the datatype of undefined is also undefined

    -in js if we wonto declare variable but dont wont to give value at that time or we
    wont to assign value latter to it then we can initialize null value to that variable it has no value
    - null meanse the variable have no value
    - null is an object
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IS NAN
    -NAN is not-A-Number
    it is not a legal value
    it is an error
    isNan() method return true if value is nan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION
    -it is a set of statement we write in a block
    -if we won to write certain code again and again that time we write function there to stop repeting of code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IS FUNCTION CURRING IN JAVASCRIPT
    it is a technique in functional programing transformation of the fun
    of multiple argument into several fun of single argument in sequence
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IS FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS :
    const add=function (){

    } 
    they will not be hoisted because they are variable now
    who dont get memory at the time of memory allocation
    (ARROW FUN AND FIRST CLASS FUNCTION ARE NOT HOISTED)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FUNCTION DECLERATION :
    function add (){

    }
    they will be hoisted becouse they will get memory at the time of memory allocation itself
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IS PURE FUNCTION 
    - A puer function is a function which always return same result
    if the same argument are pass.
    -it dose not depend on any state.

    (IN REDUX PURE FUNCTION IS TAKE STATE AND ALWAYS RETURN NEW STATE)
    in javascript pure function is always return a new data it will not modify
    iot is only depend on input argument 
    output is only depend on input argument
    eg:
    function add(x){
        return x+5
    }
    add(5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WHAT IS OPERATOR IN JAVASCRIPT
    operator are a symbole which use to perform some mathematical operation between operant
    arithmatic operetor +,-,*,/
    bitwise operator &,|,~,
    assignment operator =,+=,-=
    compartor ==,===,!=,>,<,>=,<=
    logical &&|| !
    ternary :?
    
    1)REST OPERATOR :
    function add(a,b,...c){
        console.log(a,b,c,d)
    }
    add(1,2,3,4)
    it is basically structuring all destructured value.

  2)SPREAD OPERATOR :
  let a=[1,2,3];
  let b=[4,5,6];
  let c =combination of a and b [a,b]=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
        =[...a,...b]

   it help you to destructure the non-primitive datatype(array and object)    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
   WHAT IS CLOUSER IN JAVASCRIPT 
   closour in js is basically combination of two thing function + lexical environment(nearby invironment)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

   WHAT IS FUNCTION CURRING
   if a function is returning another function then to execute that we will have to create a new variable
   and then execute or invoke that variable which wood be expensive from the memory perspective
   function curring lets you execute the returned function with the main function name only and you wont have
   to create a new  variable for that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
   WHAT IS PROTOPE
   instance of an object
   prototype are machanisn by which javascript object inherite feacture 
   from one another.
   every object in javascript has a builtine property which is called prototype
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 SPLICE: RETURN REMOVED ITEMS IN ARRAY  -----CHANGE THE ORIGINAL
 SLICE :RETURN SELECTED ELEMENT IN NEW ARRAY

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  GENERATOR FUNCTION
  -A generator function is used when we want to generator/use only some values.
  -In this way we can save memory.

 - `yield` works as same as `return` keyword but after `return` keyword if 
 there is any code it is un-reachable but with `yield` any code after
  this will also work.
 
 - Memory is created for only the which is executed,
  not every line in the function.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 GARBAGE COLLECTION;
When any data or objects or any sort of values which are not 
being use or will not be used in future as well that time we 
need someone who can remove these values from memory or 
collect this gargbage . This is known as garbage collection.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Map and Set 
WeakMap and WeakSet
WEKSET :-
   -WeakSet in JavaScript is used to store a collection of objects.
   -It adapts the same properties of that of a set and does not store duplicates.
   -The major difference of a WeakSet with the set is that a WeakSet 
   - is a collection of objects and not values of some particular type.
 
 WEKMAP :-
   -The WeakMap object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the 
   -keys are weakly referenced. The keys must be objects and the values can 
    be arbitrary values

{id: 1}

In ES5 version of JS , objects can have the keys only as 
string data type , Now if you want to create the keys as 
object so it is not possible 
{id:1}

In ES6 , we got new data type as Map which was allowing us to 
create a data type in which key and value both can be objects.
const data = new Map()
data.set({id:1},{name:"Hars"})

Ex : removing DOM elements from memory when they are removed
from DOM

Map v/s WeakMap : map is iterable whereas WeakMap are not.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS CALLBACK FUNCTION 
    a function passed as argument to another function is called as callback function.
    ex
    function name(N,info){
        
        console.log('Hi my name is ' +N)
        info()
    }
    function data(){
        console.log('Nice to meet You')
    }
    name('Abc',data)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASYNC AND AWAIT
function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve('resolved');
      }, 2000);
    });
  }
  
  async function asyncCall() {
    console.log('calling');
    const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
    console.log(result);
    // expected output: "resolved"
  }
  
  asyncCall();
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// What are the different types of errors in javascript
// "Load time error  
// Run time error "
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT ARE PROMISES AND WHY DO WE NEED THEM
-Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. 
-They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create 
-callback hell leading to unmanageable code
Benefits of Promises 
-Improves Code Readability
-Better handling of asynchronous operations
-Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
-Better Error Handling
ex:
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    const x = "meghana";
    const y = "meghana"
    if(x === y) {
        resolve();
    } else {
        reject();
    }
    });
    
    promise.
        then(function () {
            console.log('Success');
        }).
        catch(function () {
            console.log('Some error has occurred');
        });
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ES5 AND ES6
1. ECMAScript 5 (ES5P) : 
ES5 is also known as ECMAScript 2009 as it is released in 2009.
 It is a function contractors focus on how the objects are instantiated. 
 For ES5 you have to write function keyword and return, to be used to define the function,
  like normal general JavaScript language. 

2. ECMAScript 6 (ES6) : 
ES6 is also known as ECMAScript 2015 as it is released in 2015.
 Its class allows the developers to instantiate an object using the new operator,
  using an arrow function, in case it doesn’t need to use function keyword to define the function,
   also return keyword can be avoided to fetch the computer value. 

Difference between ES5 and ES6 : 
ES5                                                              ES6
  ---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
  -It was introduced in 2009.                          -It was introduced in 2015.                                                             |
  -It supports primitive data types that        
  are string, number, boolean, null, and undefined.   -In ES6, there are some additions to JavaScript data types. It introduced a new primitive data type ‘symbol’ for supporting unique values.
  -There are only one way to define the variables     -There are two new ways to define variables that are let and const.
  by using the var keyword.  
  -It has a lower performance as compared to ES6.       -It has a higher performance than ES5.
  -Object manipulation is time-consuming in ES5.	    -Object manipulation is less time-consuming in ES6.
  -In ES5, both function and return keywords are used   -An arrow function is a new feature introduced in ES6 by which we don’t require the function keyword to define the function.
   to define a function.
  -It provides a larger range of community supports    -It provides a less range of community supports than that of ES5than that of ES6
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SETTIMEOUT
The setTimeout() method executes a block of code after the specified time.
 The method executes the code only once
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello world');
}

setTimeout(greet, 3000);
console.log('This message is shown first');
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
